        This interactive online experience was created to document one simple concept: change over time. Through the use of a scrollable map and icons and their corresponding images, the viewer is able to experience the deterioration that occurs to the soles of shoes as their owner wears them. Through this, I hope to suggest the idea that change is inevitable, and that embracing it will make your journies, however you may define them, that much more rewarding.
      <br><br>Wear your shoes proudly. Let their soles fade down to nothingness and feel the dirt below you.
      </h3>
